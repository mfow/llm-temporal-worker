# Local Compose fixture

The default Compose profile starts pinned Postgres-backed Temporal, Redis, and
a deterministic OpenAI-compatible provider fixture. No provider credential is
used. Postgres and Temporal share the development-only
`${LLMTW_POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-local-only}` fixture variable; override it for any
non-local use. The worker profile is deliberately opt-in because it needs a continuation
HMAC key. The supported lifecycle gate creates that key with restrictive
permissions, uses a development-only durable file-blob volume, and removes its
own containers, volumes, images, temporary Go cache, and key when it finishes:

```sh
LLMTW_COMPOSE_LIVE=1 make compose-live-integration
```

The target is intentionally distinct from `make compose-smoke`: the latter
only validates the Compose model and never starts Docker services. The live
gate starts a uniquely named local project, checks the worker's exact
`/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints through its distroless binary,
then stops and restores Redis to verify the same liveness/readiness recovery
contract. It also runs a real Temporal SDK recovery test against that Temporal
and Redis pair.

The fixture is for development only. It uses a local-only bearer value and a
zero-cost catalog; production deployments must use external secret delivery,
real catalog digests, and the release image digest. The worker exposes the
same probes as Kubernetes: `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, and `/metrics`.

The checked-in worker profile remains a
parser/configuration/readiness fixture, not an end-to-end provider invocation
path. Provider egress is deliberately fail-closed in every environment, so
provider egress is not available to the private Docker-network address resolved
for `provider-mock`. The recovery gate injects a content-free adapter in the Go
test process instead of requesting that address; it records an accepted write,
stops one Temporal worker, starts a replacement, and requires conservative
ambiguity with no second provider dispatch or shared-budget reservation. To
make real provider requests from a local worker, use a private local
configuration with a reviewed public HTTPS provider hostname and its matching
`outbound_hosts` entry; do not weaken the policy for a Docker-private
destination.
