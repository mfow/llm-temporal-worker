# Package and Artifact Layout

The module path is `github.com/mfow/llm-temporal-worker` and the Go baseline is
1.26. Public reusable packages avoid `internal/`; process wiring and helpers that
are not stable APIs use `internal/`.

The tree below describes the packages and artifacts checked into the current
implementation. It is not a promise that every item in the v1 completion plans
already exists; planned work remains marked in those plans rather than in this
current-layout reference.

## Dependency direction

The permitted dependency direction is:

```text
cmd -> internal/runtime -> internal/app
internal/app -> activity/engine/config/storage/provider/observability
activity -> engine + Temporal SDK
engine -> llm/routing/pricing/budget/admission/state
provider adapters -> llm/provider + one official provider SDK
storage implementations -> admission/state/budget ports + backend client
domain packages -> Go standard library and narrowly selected pure libraries
```

The following imports are forbidden:

- `llm`, `routing`, `pricing`, `budget`, `admission`, or `state` importing a
  provider SDK, Temporal SDK, Redis client, or process configuration package.
- One provider adapter importing another adapter.
- The Temporal Activity performing provider conversion directly.
- The router reading environment variables or secrets.
- Storage packages importing Activity payload types.

An import-boundary test runs `go list -deps -json` and fails when these rules are
violated.

## Stable API surface

The compatibility promise covers exported types in:

- `llm`
- `llm/provider`
- `routing`
- `pricing`
- `budget`
- `admission`
- `state`
- `activity`
- `engine`

Concrete storage and provider packages may add fields compatibly but callers
should construct them through documented constructors. `internal/` has no
compatibility guarantee.

## File ownership by implementation phase

| Phase | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| Foundation | `go.mod`, `llm`, schemas, config primitives |
| Adapters | `llm/provider/*`, redacted contract fixtures |
| Routing and continuation | `routing`, `state`, memory state |
| Pricing and budgets | `pricing`, `budget`, `admission`, Redis storage |
| Worker and deployment | `engine`, `activity`, `cmd`, app wiring, observability, Docker, Kubernetes |
| Verification and release | cross-package conformance, fuzz, race, integration, live gates |

No phase may add a shortcut across a dependency boundary to make a test pass.
If an interface is insufficient, update the owning plan and its contract tests
before adding the new capability.
