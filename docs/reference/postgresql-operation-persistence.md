# PostgreSQL operation persistence

Task 5 adds the durable one-shot operation boundary used by the Temporal
worker. `storage/postgres.OperationRepository` implements the existing
`admission.AdmissionStore` lifecycle while storing the normalized request
manifest, request-fingerprint HMAC, result digest, exact-or-unknown USD cost,
and every route attempt in the worker schema.

## Replay and transitions

`Begin` derives a keyed operation key from the caller's id and scope. A replay
with the same request fingerprint returns the existing operation; a different
fingerprint returns `admission.ErrOperationConflict`. Dispatch, continuation,
completion, failure, and provider-pending updates are compare-and-set
transitions performed inside a read-committed transaction. Dispatch tokens are
deterministic HMACs of the operation UUID, so a worker restart can safely
reconstruct the token without persisting a bearer secret.

Each retry derives its attempt number from the durable attempt rows while the
operation row is locked. Provider-accepted or ambiguous failures persist an
unknown cost with a null exact amount; only rejected/not-dispatched failures
use the exact zero-cost cache method.

The engine's `tenant\x00operation-key` scope format is split only for keyed
scope lookup; the original scope key is retained in an authenticated encrypted
column. Reads hydrate the scope, lease/operation expiry, request digest, and
result reference metadata needed by the result store after a worker restart.

Provider identifiers and request/result payloads are never logged or embedded
in SQL text. The operation row stores HMACs and opaque encrypted markers; the
blob/result repository remains responsible for payload bytes.

## Cost contract

Terminal operations require either an exact `pricing.USD` amount and an
allowed method, or an unknown amount with a safe reason code. Decimal values
are bound as canonical `NUMERIC(38,18)` text. Explicit cache replays use the
`worker_cache_zero` method and the exact zero amount.

The repository is intentionally bounded to one-shot Temporal activities. It
does not add a live streaming path.

## Validation

The PostgreSQL integration tests are opt-in through the existing
`LLMTW_POSTGRES_ADDR` test configuration. Unit tests cover manifest shape,
stable HMAC/UUID derivation, safe reason normalization, and exact money
encoding. `OperationRepository.Attempts` and `AttemptRepository.List` expose
all persisted attempts for release conformance and operational inspection.
