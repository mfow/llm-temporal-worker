# v1 Activity runtime boundary

The worker registers three exact names on its configured Temporal task queue:

| Name | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `llm.generate.v1` | `llm.GenerateRequestV1` | `llm.GenerateResponseV1` |
| `llm.compact.v1` | `llm.CompactRequestV1` | `llm.CompactResponseV1` |
| `llm.query.v1` | `llm.QueryRequestV1` | `llm.QueryResponseV1` |

The Activity adapter validates the closed JSON record and the configured
application payload limit before calling the injected `activity.V1Runtime`.
Responses are validated against the same limit before Temporal serialization;
errors are converted to bounded `SafeErrorDetails` and never include prompts,
outputs, provider bodies, or identifiers from a runtime error message.

`Activities.QueryService` is an independent seam for `llm.query.v1`. It may be
provided before the Generate/Compact runtime is composed; the Activity still
fails closed when neither seam is configured. The boundary authorizes the
tenant/project/actor scope and admits all five closed query kinds: provider
status, model inventory, credit status, budget status, and spend summary. It
verifies HMAC cursors for the three keyset-paginated kinds, binding each token
to the query kind, scope/tags, canonical filter, and snapshot horizon. Budget
status and spend summary intentionally have no public cursor because each is a
single bounded snapshot. Typed handlers receive authenticated cursor claims,
including the opaque storage position and horizon, so a repeatable-read
adapter can enforce the same snapshot before reading its next page. Cursors
must be issued with the worker's typed `CursorCodec` key; the raw `Handler`
seam remains available for adapters migrating from the legacy cursor envelope.
The production client set forwards a query service only when it is supplied by
the same snapshot-scoped PostgreSQL closer as its repositories; the default
composition does not invent authorization, cursor keys, or handlers. Query
families without a configured service therefore fail closed. The reusable
PostgreSQL composition for provider status, model inventory, and credit status
is documented in [persisted-query-service.md](persisted-query-service.md) and
is installed only through an explicit `ProductionFactoryOptions.QueryServiceBuilder`.
Refresh requests, budget status, and spend summary remain fail-closed until
their dedicated repositories and management adapters are supplied. Remaining
complete Activity composition work is tracked in
[Task 14, typed Query service and Temporal Activity, of the forkable
conversation-state plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-forkable-conversation-state.md#task-14-implement-typed-query-service-and-temporal-activity).
`QueryService.Audit` is the storage-neutral seam for the audit requirement: it
receives canonical redacted request/response envelopes, SHA-256 request and
response digests, and exact-or-unknown cost metadata after all response and
cursor checks. A configured sink must persist the record before `Execute`
returns; a sink error becomes retryable state-unavailable/finalize failure.
The production Activity factory still has to connect this hook to the
repository-only [query execution audit ledger](query-audit-ledger.md).

### Query failure classification

The query service treats its handler as a durable state boundary. A raw
handler failure, including a child storage deadline while the Activity context
is still live, is wrapped as `state_unavailable` at `state_load` with
`not_dispatched` and `same_operation`; the original cause remains available to
local diagnostics but is not exposed through the Temporal error envelope.
Provider-classified errors are preserved so their authorization, provider, or
other retry semantics remain intact. If the caller's Activity context is
canceled or reaches its deadline, that terminal context result is preserved
instead of being retried as a state outage. Response/encoding and cursor
contract violations remain validation failures. An audit sink failure is the
separate retryable `state_unavailable`/`finalize` case described above, and the
response is not returned until the audit callback succeeds.

## Query service snapshot composition

During each immutable snapshot build, runtime first checks whether the client
set exposes a query service through `runtime.QueryServiceSource`. If the
`EngineFactory` also implements `runtime.QueryServiceFactory`, its
`BuildQueryService` result is authoritative and replaces the client-provided
value. A factory error aborts snapshot construction and closes the clients that
were already built, so a query repository cannot leak across a failed reload.

A factory that returns no query service without an error leaves the snapshot
valid, but `llm.query.v1` remains fail-closed with a non-retryable configuration
error and performs no provider or storage read. Each query execution acquires
the application snapshot lease before dispatch and releases it afterward;
configuration reload therefore waits for in-flight query work before closing
the old snapshot's query clients.

`V1Runtime` is the seam for the durable checkpoint, cache, provider, and
control-plane implementation. Production composition currently installs an
explicit fail-closed runtime until that implementation is wired. In every
environment other than the checked-in `development` fixture, runtime startup
refuses to start listeners or Temporal polling when this seam is still
unconfigured (`ErrV1RuntimeUnavailable`). This prevents a production process
from reporting readiness while every advertised v1 Activity would return a
non-retryable configuration error before provider dispatch. The local Compose
worker uses `environment: development` only for parser/configuration/readiness
checks; when the durable seam is absent it omits the v1 Activity registrations
and cannot dispatch inference. It is not a development fallback for any other
environment, and never silently falls back to the pre-release envelope.

The boundary is one-shot by design. It does not register or dispatch
`llm.StreamingEngine`, token events, or provider stream decoders. Provider
fragment decoders remain parser-regression code only.

## Checkpoint-aware composition seam

`activity.MaterializingV1Runtime` is the bounded composition seam for durable
checkpoint replay. A Generate request with a parent, and every Compact request,
must resolve its opaque handle through an explicitly supplied scope resolver and
handle-capable materializer before dispatch. The materialized state is passed to
the runtime's `MaterializedGenerateRuntime` or `MaterializedCompactRuntime`
extension; a runtime that does not implement the extension fails closed without
provider dispatch. Root Generate requests have no parent to replay and continue
through the ordinary `V1Runtime` method.

The seam does not perform provider, cache, budget, or checkpoint publication
work. Production composition must still provide those operations behind the
state-aware runtime and must map authenticated request context to the durable
scope identifier; raw tenant/project concatenation is intentionally not used.
