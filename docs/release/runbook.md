# Release evidence runbook

Task 23 produces a local, machine-readable release-evidence bundle. It is a
nonpublishing validation and retention step: the workflow never signs an
image, sends an image to a registry, creates a release, obtains provider
credentials, or calls a live LLM provider. Publication controls remain a
separate task.

## Trusted boundary

The `release-evidence` job runs only after `verify` on a `push` to `master`.
Pull-request, scheduled, and manual workflow executions do not collect or
retain this bundle. The job has only `contents: read` permission.

The job builds one Linux OCI layout directory at `$RUNNER_TEMP/image.oci`,
outside `release-artifacts/`, runtime-tests the image loaded by the same Buildx
solve, then obtains the immutable image subject from the layout's single OCI
manifest descriptor:

```sh
digest="$(go -C golang run ./tools/releaseverify layout-digest -layout "$RUNNER_TEMP/image.oci")"
reference="llm-temporal-worker@$digest"
```

The descriptor, rather than a local image ID or mutable tag, is the source of
truth. The retained CycloneDX SBOM and Trivy JSON scan are both bound to the
same `reference` and `digest`; the verifier rejects stale or mismatched
subjects. The raw OCI layout directory is CI-temporary only: the descriptor,
Syft, and Trivy consume that exact directory; it is never recorded or uploaded
and is removed after artifact upload. The Buildx action explicitly pins Buildx
`v0.16.2` and BuildKit `v0.16.0` by immutable image digest, so its two
same-solve exporters (`type=oci,tar=false` and `--load`) meet Docker's
multi-exporter capability requirement without a second build. Trusted CI uses
explicit Syft `v1.44.0` and Trivy `v0.72.0` inputs, with the checked-in
[Trivy configuration](../../scripts/release/trivy.yaml) applied to that
temporary directory.

Before compact manifest collection, trusted CI installs `kubectl v1.32.6` with
the immutable `azure/setup-kubectl` `v4.0.1` action commit. The collector
checks that exact client version before using `kubectl kustomize`; it has no
cluster configuration and only renders the checked-in local manifests.

## Bundle contents

The record follows [the evidence schema](evidence.schema.json). It binds every
retained artifact to a byte count and SHA-256 digest, and requires a redaction
assertion for:

- compact test, race, and deterministic fuzz summaries;
- fixture manifest records with upstream source dates;
- compact Redis, Temporal, and Compose health summaries from the local test
  stack;
- three redacted boundary-log records derived from actual `docker compose logs`
  output for Redis, Temporal, and the combined stack;
- rendered Kubernetes manifest digests and object counts;
- dependency/license inventory and the existing redacted vulnerability result;
- the CycloneDX SBOM and matching Trivy scan, each bound to the immutable
  descriptor subject.

The bundle has a closed, root-level filename set: every artifact uses the
canonical name shown below and the record is always `evidence.json`. Renamed,
nested, unreferenced, or symlinked files are rejected. A local caller may point
the verifier at a different artifact directory, but not at a different record
filename within that directory.

Repository, fixture, and dependency provenance URLs must use an absolute HTTPS
URL with a DNS hostname and no explicit port, userinfo, backslashes, query
strings, or fragments. This keeps credentials and mutable URL decorations out
of retained release evidence.

Command output, scanner diagnostics, the raw OCI layout directory, credentials,
request content, and provider payloads stay in private runner temporary
storage. Raw service output also stays there: the three retained log records
contain only fixed allowlisted event counts (`allowlist-v1`), plus the observed
line and byte counts. This preserves proof that Redis and Temporal each emitted
a safe runtime-boundary event, including both families in the combined Compose
record, without retaining arbitrary message text. The verifier scans every
retained artifact for secret-like values and rejects unsafe paths, symlinks,
residual raw OCI directories or archives, unreferenced files, digest or
byte-count changes, incomplete fixture records, mismatched image subjects, and
HIGH or CRITICAL image findings.

## Collect, record, and verify

The trusted job first produces the compact summaries and a temporary OCI layout
directory outside the retained directory:

```sh
oci_layout="$RUNNER_TEMP/image.oci"
bash scripts/release/collect.sh \
  --artifact-dir release-artifacts \
  --image-oci-layout "$oci_layout"
```

The collector rejects a layout path inside `release-artifacts/`. It then
generates the SBOM and scan from the temporary directory, binds both to the
descriptor subject above, and records the completed bundle. A local caller
must supply a temporary layout path outside its evidence directory and the two
final JSON files before it can record the exact same bundle:

```sh
digest="$(go -C golang run ./tools/releaseverify layout-digest -layout "$oci_layout")"
reference="llm-temporal-worker@$digest"

bash scripts/release/record.sh \
  -artifact-dir release-artifacts \
  -output release-artifacts/evidence.json \
  -repository https://github.com/mfow/llm-temporal-worker \
  -revision "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  -image-reference "$reference" \
  -image-digest "$digest" \
  -artifact test_summary=test-summary.json \
  -artifact race_summary=race-summary.json \
  -artifact fuzz_summary=fuzz-summary.json \
  -artifact fixture_manifest=fixture-manifest.json \
  -artifact redis_summary=redis-summary.json \
  -artifact temporal_summary=temporal-summary.json \
  -artifact compose_summary=compose-summary.json \
  -artifact redis_log=redis-log.json \
  -artifact temporal_log=temporal-log.json \
  -artifact compose_log=compose-log.json \
  -artifact rendered_manifests=rendered-manifests.json \
  -artifact dependency_license=dependencies.json \
  -artifact vulnerability_results=vulnerabilities.json \
  -artifact sbom=sbom.cdx.json \
  -artifact image_scan=image-scan.json
```

The recorder validates the entire bundle before atomically writing
`evidence.json`; a failed validation leaves no final evidence record. Validate
an already recorded local bundle with:

```sh
make release-verify
```

To validate another local bundle, invoke the verifier directly (the Make
target deliberately seals the trusted path to `release-artifacts/evidence.json`):

```sh
bash scripts/release/verify.sh \
  --artifact-dir /path/to/release-artifacts \
  --evidence /path/to/release-artifacts/evidence.json
```

After successful verification the master-push job retains the redacted bundle
for 14 days and removes `$RUNNER_TEMP/image.oci`. It never produces or
retains `image.oci.tar`, never uses `oci-archive:`, and never uses
`docker load --input`; the unretained directory is the only raw OCI subject.
`release-artifacts/` is ignored by Git and excluded from the Docker build
context.

## Current offline traceability record

The latest protected master run with a retained `release-evidence` artifact is
workflow run `29814306235` at revision
`1d5cdd2482e98dd57eea3b7e393ce42b7323edb5`. The artifact is named
`release-evidence` and has SHA-256 digest
`091c4158cb43a07397149c708729482271b2fa0ba61a1a281e17c2622b9b3e5f`.
The v1 catalog binds offline implementation and conformance records to this
run and digest. This is not production SLO evidence: the admission/compilation
p99 and worker-error-rate requirements remain explicitly unrecorded, protected
live-provider runs remain pending, and publication remains authorization-gated.

## Guarded manual publication boundary

Task 24 adds `.github/workflows/release.yml` as a deliberately incomplete
publication control. It has only a `workflow_dispatch` trigger, and both jobs
reject a dispatch that is not started from `master`. A human must provide all
three immutable inputs:

- a strict protected tag reference in the form
  `refs/tags/vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (lightweight and annotated tags both resolve
  to their one target commit);
- a fully qualified `registry/repository@sha256:...` image reference; and
- the numeric workflow run ID for the successful master `release-evidence`
  bundle that proves that exact tag commit and digest.

There is intentionally no default registry. Before any manual run, an
administrator must configure the non-secret repository variable
`RELEASE_PUBLICATION_IMAGE_REPOSITORY` with the exact trusted registry and
repository path. The guard rejects a missing, malformed, tag-based, or
different image reference; it also rejects a branch ref, a malformed tag, a
tag that is not reachable from protected master, a non-numeric run ID, an
unavailable or untrusted evidence run, an unavailable artifact, or any
evidence revision/digest mismatch.

The preflight receives only `contents: read` and `actions: read`. It uses the
automatic, job-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` only as the input to GitHub's pinned
`actions/download-artifact` action; the token is never placed in a shell
environment, logged, or passed to another action. This short-lived read token
is not a provider, registry, or OIDC credential.

Because `actions/checkout` v6 requires a token input even for public
repositories, the preflight does not use it. Before it passes a manual ref to
Git, it validates the tag's strict `refs/tags/vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` shape in a
shell environment. It then performs a fixed unauthenticated HTTPS Git fetch
from `https://github.com/mfow/llm-temporal-worker.git`, with an empty temporary
Git home, no system Git configuration, disabled prompting, and no credential
helper. The checkout fails closed if the workspace is not empty, the exact tag
cannot be fetched, or fetched `master` is not the protected workflow's
`github.sha`; it checks out that master SHA only, never the manual tag. Thus no
manual ref can select code that runs before the normal protected-master and
tag-ancestry guards below.

This repository is public, so before that download the local guard makes a
credential-free HTTPS `GET` to the public GitHub Actions run endpoint. It
fails closed on network, API, rate-limit, size, or JSON errors and requires the
returned run to name this repository, use `.github/workflows/master.yml`, be a
completed successful `push` to `master`, and have the exact commit resolved
from the release tag. The only job that can retain the `release-evidence`
artifact is the `release-evidence` job in that workflow; its contract requires
a successful master verification before upload. The downloader then requests
that exact artifact name from the validated run, and local Task 23 verification
requires its complete evidence bundle to bind the same revision and image
digest. If the repository ever becomes private, this public lookup must remain
fail-closed until a separately authorized design supplies an equivalent trust
boundary without widening the token's scope.

The downstream job names the `release-publication` protected environment and
is the only job with `id-token: write`. Repository administrators must create
and protect that environment before enabling an actual publication capability:
configure required human approvals, protected tag policy, and the cloud
identity trust subject/audience for that environment. This repository change
does not create or modify that environment, configure a registry, establish an
OIDC trust relationship, or add credentials.

The protected job always exits nonzero after preflight. It does not sign, publish, push, create a tag, or create a release. Consequently an unavailable or unconfigured registry fails closed rather than becoming a silent skip or a claimed release. Do not treat a successful preflight, an environment approval, or this workflow definition as evidence that any image was signed or published; a separately authorized follow-up must implement those irreversible operations.
