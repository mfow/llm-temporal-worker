# Architecture Decision Records

The first five decisions describe current implementation. Decisions 0006
through 0008 define staged target designs; acceptance does not claim that any
phase has shipped. [Scope](../scope.md#staged-delivery-and-document-authority)
owns phase and document authority. A specification defect or measured evidence
may change an accepted design through a short superseding ADR amendment rather
than silent divergence or knowingly faithful implementation of a defect.
